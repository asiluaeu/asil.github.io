## About us 

CAST (Connected and Intelligent Autonomous System Research Group) is a leading research group based at UAE University. CAST is primarily engaged with the research and development of networked autonomous unmanned systems. Researchers this group are concerned with the design and developmentmethods and techniques that facilitate the deployment of smart applications based on networked smart ground and aerial vehicles, Internet of Things (IoT) platforms, Edge computing, and Neuro-engineering brain-computer interactions (BCI) applications. The group is composed of dynamic faculty members, researchers and students, as well as world-wide visiting researchers.
